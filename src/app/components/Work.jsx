            This is an amazing tool for uninterrupted binge watch. Itâ€™s just you
            have to download and install the extension. You can customize your
            user icon and invite your dear ones to start the party. While
            streaming a movie, you can chat or do audio/ video calls. The fun
            part is you can also enjoy synchronized streaming of shows and
            movies from which you can watch with your family and friends. It
            also provides high-quality streaming and a seamless way to enjoy
            content together from the comfort of your own space.
